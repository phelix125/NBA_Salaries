This folder contains all of the images and notebooks for our data science final project. We created a linear regression model to predict
nba first year salaries, purely based off of their college statistics. 


FP_PRE is where we did all of our preprocessing, since we had two datasets, we had to match them on name. We also normalized, and did encoding on all of our 
catorgical data here.

FP_REG is where we tested multiple regression models, OLS, Lasso, Ridge, etc. We also have plots of all of our explatory analysis in here.
